The alt attribute is used as a textual description of the image. It should always be provided, since it is also useful for accessibility. Screen readers can read the description of the picture to the user and in case the image is not available, the description that was assigned as value to the alt attribute is being displayed. This too adds to accessibility.
Accessibility in this scenario means that a website, program, os, or app is designed to be accessible to all people including disabled people. In Germany it is mandatory by law (Barrierefreiheitsst√§rkungsgesetz (BFSG)) to provide accessibility to your products and services. All standards are either based on or derived from the WAI-ARIA standard (most recent: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).
