        <p>If Atlantis were real (read: and not currently underneath the Atlantic), you know this would be its flag. It’s simple, it’s elegant, it’s got a freaking trident on it. Poseidon himself certainly would’ve flown this bad boy.</p>

        <p>One of only two national flags with a dragon on it, I gotta give the “coolest” award to the flag of Bhutan. The Welsh flag is pretty sweet as well, but Bhutan’s has got the Thunder Dragon on there. Like Buddhist monks back in the 12th century, I understand that you don’t fuck with something that has “Thunder” included in its name. So I’m not about to start doing that now.</p>
